# Go learning

Welcome to my repository for exploring and practicing Go (Golang)! This space serves as a log for my journey into Go development, showcasing small projects and experiments as I deepen my understanding of the language and its ecosystem.

#### About This Repository

This repository is a collection of small projects, exercises, and code snippets written in Go.

#### Why Go?

As a frontend developer expanding into backend technologies, I find Go's simplicity, efficiency, and robust concurrency model appealing. Through these projects, I aim to:

- Understand Go syntax and paradigms.
- Explore core libraries and features.
- Build and deploy lightweight backend solutions.
